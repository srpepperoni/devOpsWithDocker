## Description

I delivered every single exercise with [script linux command](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/script.1.html), to ensure that I truly send what really happens in my machine.

For a cleaner revision of this script files I had to manually fix some encoding issues. I hope that everything appears fine.
